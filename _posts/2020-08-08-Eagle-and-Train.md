Once was an eagle which fell in love with a train, and the train fell in love with the eagle.
The train was a special kind of train, he needed rabbits to survive exactly like the eagle.
Both the train and the eagle were hungry for rabbits.
The eagle was able to see far away where rabbits were, the train on the railroad was lucky and get a lot of rabbit, enough to feed him and the eagle. When there were an excess of rabbit the eagle and the train would store it in the train.
So once in a while the eagle would come close to the train and get som rabbit.
The eagle helped the train to get more rabbits, he helped the train so much by telling him where it could be better to go. The train could only switch his way where switch were. After a switch the train had to go full speed in the chosen direction. At the next switch, the train would again be able to change direction.
The eagle was able to go everywhere, on place with a lot of rabbit. But by love the eagle decide to stick  with the train. But strangely the train stopped to listen the eagle, the eagle keep following his love. But he was going to a place were rabbit were difficult to find and hard to chew.
Some would say the eagle was losing a lot of time talking to the train. But for the eagle it was a proof of love to his beloved train.
Some would say that the eagle should go somewhere else to hide rabbit by his own.
There is nothing logical for the eagle to follow a train.
The trains says to the eagle : “Come with me”. 
But the eagle see that where the train is going there is only unhealthy rabbits that are hard to chew and difficult to find, he told to the train to switch so many time before to go there. But the train was convinced he has to go to the land of the difficult rabbit.
If only the train was has free as the eagle he could come with the eagle, to a place with enough rabbit for both of them to hide and to enjoy. They could meet other rabbit lover like them and enjoy then life of abondance.
But the train can only go in straight line, he goes fast and far.
The eagle cannot drive a train or change the switch for the train. The eagle has a vision and the train has his own, but the train is the one who take the decisions.

The eagle love the train and accept not to go to the best directions with the train.
The train love the eagle and he is to busy going straight and fast to listen the eagle.
The eagle could fly so far, eat so many rabbits by is own, but he loves the train so much... He keep following without a doubt his lovely train.
Eagle say to the train:
“My love, I see you gooing straight but you should rest a little, take the time to think and to go to an other place, I can see that when you drive you don't want to think about the switch, why not make a plan and prepare for the next switch together ?”. We can find together a better place where you would have more time to see the beautiful landscape along the way, but the train is to tired that he can't listen and the same repeated noises of the eagle makes him angry.
So the train continue to go full speed straight. The train and the eagle were going far when one day, the a storm took the eagle into a land with really few rabbits, far away from the train. 
The eagle was alone, with not rabbit. He felt so insecure and so sad to be far from the train.
Then a djiin came to the eagle and told him he could help the eagle to talk with the train.

{:.text-justify}
The eagle was so happy to be able to speak with the train. Do you know what the train decided to do when he received the messages from the djiin saying that his lovely eagle was having trouble and that if he wanted he could send some rabbit thanks to the djiin power. The train decide to ignore the call and did not send anything to his lover.
{:.text-justify}
The eagle began to ask himself question. What did he do wrong ? He helps train, even if at the end the train did not accept it... Maybe the train did not love him... Or maybe the train did not receive the message from the djiin... Or maybe the train did not understood the emergency of the situation.

{:.text-justify}
The eagle is wondering what to do... What would you do ? 
{:.text-justify}
The eagle feel betrayed, he feel disapointed, he had invested so many years of his life following his lover. For sure he enjoyed it ! But at the end, the eagle has nothing for him, just his ability to hunt again. For sure the eagle need to find a way to survive by his own. He needs to hunt for rabbits even if it's hard and not as easy as it was with his fast and strong friend. The eagle felt so disoriented and suddenly so lonely.
{:.text-justify}
Why the train do not understnad the eagle needs to simply survive or get some gratefulness. Does the eagle should have made rabbit reserve by his own instead? The eagle was so focused on the best road for his beloved train that he forgot to follow his own road. Sometimes in life we keep following trains, or we even become one : Too fast, too furious to care about people who care about us. A train is so efficient if there is a an eagle to help the navigation process, and an eagle without a train could not hunt as much rabbit alone. The Eagle did not need train to survive and the train did not need the eagle to survive :  it's a choice and should always be. The train should have been taking care of the eagle but he was too busy to do it. That's why the train should have worked on setting the eagle free by making a special rabbit for him in case they had to fall apart.

{:.text-justify}
We can all be eagle and trains and we need to care about each other. Not only in present day but also for the future that has to come. If you love people let them be free to love you. Care about you first like the train and help people around you to be free.
